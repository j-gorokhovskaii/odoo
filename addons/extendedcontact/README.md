## Usage

### Adding Personal Information to Contacts

1. Go to **Contacts** â†’ **Customers**
2. Create a new contact or edit an existing one
3. For individual contacts, you'll see the following fields:
   - **Date of Birth**: Enter birth date (e.g., 15/03/1990)
   - **Age**: Automatically calculated and displayed
   - **Height (cm)**: Enter height in centimeters (e.g., 175.5)

   - **Hair Color**: Select from dropdown (Black, Brown, Blonde, Red, Gray, White, Other)
   - **Other Distinguishing Features**: Free text for additional characteristics

### Validation Rules

- Birth date cannot be in the future
- Height must be between 50 and 250 centimeters
- Weight must be between 20 and 300 kilograms
- Only individual contacts (not companies) can have these values
- All fields are optional

### Searching and Filtering

The module adds comprehensive search options:

**Birth Date Filters:**
- Has Birth Date / No Birth Date

**Height Filters:**
- Has Height / No Height
- Height 150cm+ / Height 180cm+

**Weight Filters:**
- Has Weight / No Weight

- Brown Eyes / Blue Eyes / Green Eyes

**Hair Color Filters:**

### List View

In the contacts list view, you can optionally display the following columns for individual contacts:
- Age (computed)
- Height
- Weight
- Eye Color
- Hair Color
